# React Shopping Cart

React project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-cart) curriculum.

The point of this project was to build a basic shop page in React utilizing routers and hooks. I added in Tailwind to try my hand in CSS class-based frameworks as well.

The challenging part of this project for me was passing down functions to handle states and utilizing UseEffects hook properly.
